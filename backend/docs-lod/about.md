# About

The *OSM Measure Repository* is a project of the GIScienc Research Group at Heidelberg University.  It aims at fostering research about data quality measures related to OpenStreetMap (OSM).

If you consider this repository to be useful for your work, we would be happy to get a [feedback](mailto:mocnik@uni-heidelberg.de).  Feel free to use the repository for your own research.  The repository can be cited by referring to the following relevant papers:
