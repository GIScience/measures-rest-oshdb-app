The *OSM Measure Repository* is a collection of data quality measures (and general measures) for OpenStreetMap (OSM).  It aims at fostering research about data quality measures related to OpenStreetMap (OSM).

Feel free to use the repository for your own research.  The repository can and should be cited by referring to the following relevant papers:
